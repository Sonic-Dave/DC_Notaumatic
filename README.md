# DC_Notaumatic

# APA Notaumatic scoring system panel mounted XT30 battery connector upgrade.

The existing battery connectors of our Tasmanian TPA club Notaumatic scoring systems have been problematic, causing regular resets and one unit being unusable.

This project is to replace the existing red JST connectors with XT30 type connectors.

Additionally adding a panel mount for the XT30 connector reduces damage to the connected wire on the device side hopfully preventing future failure.


# Parts required

1. 3D printed part and back plate.
   * Material PLA+ (I printed at 101% as the design is a little tight on the XT30 connector)
3. 2 x XT30 connector set (plug and socket)
4. Silicone wire 20AWG
5. 2 x Screw and nut M3x16
6. Heatshrink


# Doing it

Open up the Notaumatic  

Solder 130mm length of Red and Black wire to 1 Male XT30 connector 
Add heatshrink

If existing gromet is low enough on the panel you can pass the wire through otherwise you may need to redrill the gromet hole  
Line up the bracket on the back panel and mark mounting holes  
Drill holes 3.5mm
